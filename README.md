# react-leaflet-rotatable-marker
Provides rotatable markers for Leaflet maps as first-class React components

The underlying implementation is largely drawn from https://github.com/bbecquet/Leaflet.RotatedMarker
but changed to provide an extension of the Marker type, rather than updating
the type itself and then wrapped in a React component
